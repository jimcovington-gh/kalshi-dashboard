# Voice Trader Dev Environment Configuration
# 
# Copy this file to .env.local to use the dev backend:
#   cp .env.local.dev .env.local
#   npm run dev
#
# The dashboard will connect to the dev voice trader server
# instead of production.

# Dev Voice Trader Backend
NEXT_PUBLIC_VOICE_TRADER_HOST=dev-voice.apexmarkets.us

# Note: Once DNS is set up, this will resolve to the dev EC2 at 52.200.32.130
# Until then, you can use the IP directly (but TLS won't work):
# NEXT_PUBLIC_VOICE_TRADER_HOST=52.200.32.130
